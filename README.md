For our app, Design Your Life, we wanted to give individuals the opportunity
to test out how different aspects of their life would work together. From 
different looks, to different jobs and pets, our users will be able to visualize
what they want their future to look like.

The main functions for the "You, House, Job, and Pet" pages are all similar. Each page
has a previous, save, and next button that allows the user to click through potential
choices. Once the save button is clicked, their option will be saved to their account.

Speaking of persistent data, our app begins with a register page. Here, an individual can
create an account to save their choices. If the user chooses to log out, they can 
log back in using the same email and password that they registered with.
